# AI2048

This is a clone of the popular 2048 game. I wrote this program in C++11 using the SFML library for graphics. It is essentially an animation of an AI based on a Pure Monte Carlo tree search playing 2048.

## Getting Started

Compiling the game requires installation of the SFML library and C++11. If you are on linux, you can install C++11 and SFML
from your package manager. If you are on Windows or macOS, I recommend installing g++ from this link:
http://gcc.gnu.org

On Windows or macOS, installing the SFML library entails navigating to this link:  
https://www.sfml-dev.org  
and downloading and installing the SFML library using the instructions in the readme file that is packaged with SFML.

## Compiling the program

Once you have the dependencies (C++11 and SFML) installed, type the following command into a terminal to compile and run the
game:

```
make
./bin/ai2048
```
